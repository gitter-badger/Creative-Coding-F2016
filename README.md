Modify the **sketch.js** file to create a snowman using 3 ellipses. Use variables correctly so that the snowman:

1. moves as a unit when the variables of "x" and "y" are changed
2. scales appropriately when the "multiplier" variable is adjusted
```javascript
var x = 200;
var y = 200;
var multiplier = 1;
```
